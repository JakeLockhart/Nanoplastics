# Nanoplastics
Processing/analysis scripts for microscopy/histology/in vivo assays related to nanoplastics

- **MassSpectrometryDataAnalysis**: Data retrived from the Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Core Facility are provided within standardized excel sheets. This MatLab class allows for easier analysis of the proteomics data enabling the user to include additional parameters to the data (such as normalized spectral abundance fator) and compare individual data sets against one another both by creating new .xlsx tables and plots.
- **OlfactoryAssayBootStrap**: Bootstrap statistical analysis of a buried food-seeking test to assess olfactory impairment in mice.
